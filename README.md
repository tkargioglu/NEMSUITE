# NEMSUITE
A Software Tool for Analyzing Nanoelectromechanical Sensing Systems

NEMSUITE offers three analysis modes. Full stochastic simulation mode produces the most accurate results but takes hours to run. Baseband equivalent stochastic simulation mode reduces analysis runtime considerably with little loss of accuracy. Finally, analysis-based model evaluation mode, that is based on a detailed analytical theory [1], avoids lengthy stochastic simulations and produces results that very well match the ones produced by expensive simulations.
